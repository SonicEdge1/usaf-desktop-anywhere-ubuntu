# usaf-desktop-anywhere-ubuntu
repository for script to install desktop anywhere on Ubuntu

The AFRC first developed Desktop Anywhere (DA) as a way to help reservists connect safely to resources normally available only on base in a NIPPR environment. 
DA installs were developed and supported for Windows and Mac, but not any Linux environments.
This script installs the necessary elements for an Ubuntu install.
